9. Now, to link the Battlefield V Stat Checker bot with your freshly made one you will have to get its Token, click here to reveal it

Discord will show you your bot's token, be sure to keep it save! If not, people can mess up your bot real good.  

10. When you boot up the Battlefield V Stat Checker and it is the first time, it will probably show you this screen

No need to worry, you just need to enter your Bot Token here, just as shown in the image above, and hit return.  
After this it will either A. Complain about your token being wrong, or B. Run as intended.  
If it does C. feel free to open an issue right [here](https://github.com/RobinCPel/Battlefield-V-Stat-Checker/issues) and if I am not busy with school or work I just might fix it. üòÖ  

11. This step is optional, if you did not enter your correct Bot Token you can do one of the two things. Delete the "bot-token.json" file and reboot the bot, or open the "bot-token.json" file and replace the wrong token with the correct one as shown below
