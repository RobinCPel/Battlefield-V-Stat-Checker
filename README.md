# 🔫 Battlefield V Stat Checker - Discord Bot 🔫
A Discord bot for requesting Battlefield V stats.

## About
Battlefield V Stat Checker is a Discord bot written for me and my friends to show off our amazing Battlefield V skills in our Discord server! 😎  
It is written 100% in Kotlin (if you exclude the Java libraries It's using 😋), Kotlin is a relatively young language which you can get more info about [here](https://kotlinlang.org/).  
This bot heavily relies on the Discord4J library which can be found [here](https://discord4j.com/).

## Requirements 👊🏻
- Java 8 or newer ☕
- A machine to run it on 💻

## Before adding the bot to your Discord server 🤓
- Be sure to check all of the requirements listed above ⬆
- Check out [this](HOW-TO-RUN.MD) tutorial on how to get this bot up and running on your own pc/server! 💻

## Recommendations
I would most certainly reccomend to run the bot on a device that's powered on 24/7, for example, I currently have a Raspberry Pi 3B at home which is hosting two Discord bots at the same time 24/7. The Raspberry Pi is a very small and affordable computer, you can find out more about it [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). 

## Adding the bot to your Discord server 💪🏻
You can use this shortcut to invite the bot to your Discord server, be sure to replace "CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE" with your client ID❗❗

## Sidenotes 📝
This Bot retrieves its data from [Battlefield Tracker](https://battlefieldtracker.com/), without them this bot could never have been realised. 🙏🏻
